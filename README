README:
	A Makefile is provided to compile the three programs.
	
	P1 is the program which utilizes the sytem calls open(), read(), and 	write().
	
	P2 is the program which utilies the library functions fopen(), fread() (in 		this case I used fgets() instead of fread(), and fwrite(),
	
	P3 is the program which utilizes memory-mapped file I/O.
	
	After compiling, be sure to navigate to the same directory as the programs. 		From there, run the following commands:
		./P1 Input1.txt Input1Output.txt
		
		./P2 Input2.txt Input2Output.txt
		
		./P3 Input3.txt
	
	As you can see, I have provided the input text files for all three programs 		and the output files for Program 1 and Program 2. However, you are free to 		test these programs with different input. For Program 1 and 2, the output 		files should be empty.
