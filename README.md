# File Handling In C/C++
The objective of this project is to create three programs that 
1. Open an input file
2. Change the upper-case letters to lower-case and the lower-case letters to upper-case
3. Write the results back to the original input file or a separate output file

A readme is included in the project files for instructions on how to compile and use the code.

My goal with this project was to further my understanding of the differences between regular file I/O with system calls and library functions and memory-mapped file I/O.
