# File Handling In C/C++
The objective of this project is to create three programs that 
1. open an input file
2. change the upper-case letters to lower-case and the lower-case letters to upper-case
3. write the results back to the original input file or a separate output file

A readme is included in the project files for instructions on how to compile and use the code.
